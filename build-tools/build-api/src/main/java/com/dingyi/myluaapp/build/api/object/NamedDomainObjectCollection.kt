/**
 *
 * A `NamedDomainObjectCollection` represents a collection of objects that have an inherent, constant, name.
 *
 *
 * Objects to be added to a named domain object collection must implement `equals()` in such a way that no two objects
 * with different names are considered equal. That is, all equality tests **must** consider the name as an
 * equality key. Behavior is undefined if two objects with different names are considered equal by their `equals()` implementation.
 *
 *
 * All implementations **must** guarantee that all elements in the collection are uniquely named. That is,
 * an attempt to add an object with a name equal to the name of any existing object in the collection will fail.
 * Implementations may choose to simply return false from `add(T)` or to throw an exception.
 *
 *
 * Objects in the collection are accessible as read-only properties, using the name of the object
 * as the property name. For example (assuming the 'name' property provides the object name):
 *
 * <pre>
 * books.add(new Book(name: "gradle", title: null))
 * books.gradle.title = "Gradle in Action"
</pre> *
 *
 *
 * A dynamic method is added for each object which takes a configuration closure. This is equivalent to calling
 * [.getByName]. For example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * books.add(new Book(name: "gradle", title: null))
 * books.gradle {
 * title = "Gradle in Action"
 * }
</pre> *
 *
 *
 * You can also use the `[]` operator to access the objects of a collection by name. For example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * books.add(new Book(name: "gradle", title: null))
 * books['gradle'].title = "Gradle in Action"
</pre> *
 *
 *
 * [Rule] objects can be attached to the collection in order to respond to requests for objects by name
 * where no object with name exists in the collection. This mechanism can be used to create objects on demand.
 * For example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * books.addRule('create any') { books.add(new Book(name: "gradle", title: null)) }
 * books.gradle.name == "gradle"
</pre> *
 *
 * @param <T> The type of objects in this collection.
</T> */
