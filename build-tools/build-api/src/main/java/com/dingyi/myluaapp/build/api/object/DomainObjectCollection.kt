 * A `DomainObjectCollection` is a specialised [Collection] that adds the ability to receive modification notifications and use live filtered sub collections.
 *
 *
 * The filtered collections returned by the filtering methods, such as [.matching], return collections that are *live*. That is, they reflect
 * changes made to the source collection that they were created from. This is true for filtered collections made from filtered collections etc.
 *
 *
 * You can also add actions that are executed as elements are added to the collection. Actions added to filtered collections will be fired if an addition/removal
 * occurs for the source collection that matches the filter.
 *
 *
 * `DomainObjectCollection` instances are not *thread-safe* and undefined behavior may result from the invocation of any method on a collection that is being mutated by another
 * thread; this includes direct invocations, passing the collection to a method that might perform invocations, and using an existing iterator to examine the collection.
 *
